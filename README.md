# So you wanna run a school?

This is an example of a relational database model for a university registry. It could be used instead of, for example, running your entire student system off a shared Excel spreadsheet.

*Not that anyone would do that...*

It is a work-in-progress.


**To Do:**
* Define roles/users
* Check data types (and lengths)
* Consider indexes
* Consider (further) input constraints
* Input sample records
* ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯
